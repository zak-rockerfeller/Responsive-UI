# Responsive-UI
This repository contains responsive UI which is all about creating flexible design solutions.

Responsive web design is an approach that allows design across various devices (mobile, desktop, tablet, etc.) and suggests design should respond to the user’s behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation.

Some people think that responsive web design is all about fitting design to various screen resolutions. That’s not entirely true. Responsive design represents a whole new way of thinking about design. It’s about creating flexible design solutions. To represent responsive design, Josh Clark, memorably adapted the famous Bruce Lee quote Be Water, My Friend when he coined content is like water.
"You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put water into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. "

In the world of web design, we have a few terms that describe the process of design optimization for various screens— responsive, adaptive and mobile-first designs. You may wonder what exactly is the difference between all of them?

Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, but there are some differences between them. Responsive web design uses CSS media queries to dynamically change the page layout based on the target device such as display type, width, height, etc. Adaptive design, on the other hand, uses static layouts based on breakpoints that don’t respond once they’re loaded. As you can see, adaptive design is a less flexible solution for the problem of design optimizations for various screens.

“Mobile-first” is a conceptual term. As the name suggests, mobile-first means that web designers start the product design from the mobile medium and then design tablet, desktop, and monitors. “Mobile first” way of thinking for design helps product teams to focus on the most important content and deliver it to users.
